# Tweets-depression-detector
In the 21st century, mental illness has surged, leading to the development of various methods for treatment. The primary challenge remains accurately detecting whether an individual is truly suffering from a mental health condition. Leveraging technology to address this issue can significantly enhance the diagnosis and management of mental illnesses like depression. AI and machine learning algorithms can analyse patterns in speech, text, and behaviour to identify signs of depression and other mental health issues. These technologies can process large datasets, identifying subtle indicators that might be missed by human observation.
Hence, Me along with Ms.Paridhi Gusain under the team name of Depbots are presenting you a depression detecting bot which detects depression on the basis of a person's tweet. we have used the 'sentiment 140' dataset available on kaggle and can be accessed by this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140?resource=download&select=training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv).
We have used nltk library present in python in order to preprocess the data and with the help of concept of RNN(recurrent neural networks) and deep learning we have built this model. This NLP model helps us to define whether a tweet has a feeling of depression or not.
